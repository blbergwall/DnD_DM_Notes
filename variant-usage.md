This document lists the D&D 5th edition rules that are marked as "Variant" or "Optional" in the
rules that will (and maybe will not) be used in games I run.  If a variant is not covered here
assume we are not using it but feel free to ask me.

## Part 1 Creating a Character

## Part 2 Playing the Game

### Chapter 9: Combat
