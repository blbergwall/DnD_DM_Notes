This document lists the D&D 5th edition rules that are marked as "Variant" or "Optional" in the
rules that will (and maybe will not) be used in games I run.  If a variant is not covered here
assume we are not using it but feel free to ask me.

## Part 1 Creating a Character

* Character options not in the Player Handbook (race, class, Background...)
	* I believe the standard is to allow each player to use the Players Handbook plus one other
resource to pick character options from.

* Variant: Customizing Ability Scores
	* Players may chose this or either of the other two options to determine ability scores.
	* If you roll and roll bad be prepared to accept the results with no bitching.

### Chapter 6: Customization Options

* Multiclassing, I am inclined to not allow multiclassing, I could see making an exception if
something comes up as part of game play that causes it to make a lot of sense.
* Feats, I am fine with players taking feats, seems like giving up ability score increases makes
them balanced.

## Part 2 Playing the Game

### Chapter 9: Combat

* Variant: Playing on a Grid
	* We will use this variant unless a combat looks very simple.
	* From DM Guide we will use "Optional Rule: Flanking"
	* From DM Guide we will use "Optional Rule: Diagonals"
		* Every other diagonal movement costs 10 ft instead of 5 ft
	* From DM Guide we will **NOT** use "Optional Rule: Facing"
